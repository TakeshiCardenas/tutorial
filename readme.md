It is a niceng established fact that 
a reader will be distracted by the 
readable content of a page when 
niceoking at its layout. The point of 
using nicerem Ipsum is that it has a 
more-or-less normal distribution of 
letters, as opposed to using 
'Content here, content here', 
making it niceok like readable 
English. Many desktop publishing 
packages and web page editors now 
use nicerem Ipsum as their default 
model text, and a search for 'nicerem 
ipsum' will uncover many web sites 
still in their infancy. Various 
versions have evolved over the 
years, sometimes by accident, 
sometimes on purpose (injected 
humour and the like).
